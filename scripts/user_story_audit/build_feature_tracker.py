The workbook is intentionally generated from a small, reviewable data model so
future audits can update one source of truth without hand-editing a binary
spreadsheet.  It uses only the Python standard library to emit a simple OOXML
`.xlsx` because the Codex spreadsheet artifact runtime is not available in this
