//! Verification/reproduction test for the `mcp-dispatch-comms` review batch,
//! finding 4 (low / resource-leak).
//!
//! A plain self-dispatch with a `branch` leases + binds a worktree BEFORE
//! the API rejects the self-send, orphaning the worktree.
//!
//! `handle_delegate_task` (src/mcp/handlers/comms.rs) rejects a self-send
//! only when team-orchestrator resolution actually CHANGED the target:
//!   `if *sender == target && raw_target != target { return ...self-loop... }`
//! A plain self-dispatch where `raw_target == resolved_target == sender`
//! skips that guard, falls through to `dispatch_auto_bind_lease_with_source_and_chain`
//! (which creates a worktree + writes a binding), and only THEN reaches the
//! API SEND which rejects the self-send — leaving a leased worktree +
//! binding for a dispatch that never delivered, with no rollback on this
//! path.
//!
//! Static-invariant method (source scan): the runtime leak cannot be
//! driven without registering instances + a real API/daemon. Instead we
//! pin the FIX: an UNCONDITIONAL self-send rejection (`*sender == target`,
//! regardless of whether resolution changed the target) must appear in
//! `handle_delegate_task` BEFORE the `dispatch_auto_bind_lease_with_chain`
//! call — so no worktree is leased for a dispatch the API will reject.
//!
//! RED now: the only `*sender == target` check before the auto-bind is the
//! qualified `*sender == target && raw_target != target` guard, so a plain
//! self-dispatch reaches the lease. No unconditional self-send rejection
//! precedes the auto-bind.
//!
//! GREEN after fix: moving an unconditional `*sender == target` rejection
//! ahead of the auto-bind makes this scan find it.
