/// redirected into the bound worktree even though the caller's cwd is a
/// DIFFERENT object store — silently acting on someone else's branch:
///
/// - `checkout` / `switch` — measured: a `git checkout -b X` in an unrelated
///   `%TEMP%` repo moved the bound worktree's HEAD to `X`, and the agent's next
///   commit landed on `X`. Nothing failed; the branch name is one bracketed
///   token in `git commit`'s output.
/// - `clean` — `git clean -fdx` in a foreign repo would wipe the bound
///   worktree. Same path, strictly worse (unrecoverable, and no output to
///   notice it in).
/// - `restore --staged`, `update-ref`, `symbolic-ref <n> <ref>`, and every
///   unknown-to-`classify` subcommand (`gc`, `fsck`, `notes`, `bisect`, …).
///
/// The seatbelt existed and worked; the violators were simply not in its set.
/// So this does NOT add another enumerated list — enumerating is what failed.
/// It states the correct condition instead: **once the caller has cd'd into a
/// different object store, the premise of `ChdirPass` is gone.**
///
/// # What it deliberately does NOT change
///
/// - **`bare_form` only.** With a leading `-C` / `--git-dir` / `--work-tree`,
///   the cwd is not where git would act, and `Passthrough` would let that
///   override carry the write to any target — canonical included. #2950 already
///   ruled that only the cwd-targeted form is a policy path; this follows that
///   precedent rather than inventing a second rule.
/// - **`push` is untouched.** It classifies to `CleanupAndChdirPushPass`, not
///   `ChdirPass`, so every protected-ref / force-lease / trust-root guard on the
///   push path is outside this function's reach by construction.
/// - **`Deny` is untouched** (foreign submodule writes still deny).
/// - **A non-foreign cwd is untouched** — a bound agent working in its own
///   worktree keeps being routed there, byte-identically.
///
/// # Known gap (⛔ NOT fixed here)
///
/// A cwd that is in **no repo at all** is not "foreign": `paths_are_foreign`
/// fails closed to `false` when `resolve_commondir` returns `None`, so a bound
/// agent's non-read subcommand in a non-repo directory is STILL `ChdirPass`.
/// #3142 covers only the read-only set there. Closing that changes behavior
