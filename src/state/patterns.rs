/// #1639/#1642; one edit now applies uniformly). Sourced from #1136's
/// operator-observed proxy/network faults (`InvalidHTTPResponse`,
/// `ECONNRESET`/`ETIMEDOUT`, `fetch failed`, `connection reset`) plus the
/// realistic Node messages `socket hang up` / `proxy disconnect`.
///
/// #1587 deliberately does NOT blind-tighten these tokens. ServerRateLimit is
/// already `is_high_fp_state`, so the #919 red-SGR anchor + #1518 live-bottom-N
/// gate apply, and #1586 eliminated the retry-storm — the residual is ≤1
/// red-gated spurious `continue`. Tightening risks false-NEGATIVES: the English
/// phrases ARE the Node backends' literal error messages, and the real
/// rendering carries an `Error:`/`FetchError:` label prefix that a line-start
/// anchor would reject (cf. the `detect("Error: ECONNRESET")` test). A proper
/// tighten would need captured per-backend network-error fixtures — a deferred
/// follow-up only if the single FP ever becomes a real problem.
///
/// The bare `network error` token WAS dropped: it was never in #1136's observed
/// list (an unverified guess), is the most prose-FP-prone of the set, and no
/// backend was observed emitting it literally — so dropping it is
/// false-negative-free (the #1136 coverage test never listed it either).
// #8 Phase 2 (KiroCli migration): pub(crate) so the co-located BackendProfile
// references this shared net-error alternation by the SAME const (not a re-typed
// copy). (#1580: the legacy compile_for arm that also used it is now gone.)

// t-coloranchor-remove-ratelimit: ServerRateLimit now uses the general content
// anchor (`in_error_line`) instead of the red anchor, so the net-error special
// case (net faults render grey → exempt from red) is subsumed — a grey net-error
// on an error-line-shaped line latches via content, and a bare prose mention is
// suppressed by content + #1518 position. The shared const above stays: it is
// still the ServerRateLimit DETECTION pattern (backend_profile + compile_for).

/// Does some on-screen occurrence of `matched` sit in a real backend ERROR LINE
/// (vs a bare prose/source mention of the same token)?
///
/// Generalized from the #1768 net-error gate (was `net_error_in_error_line`) so
/// the content-shape signal can serve EVERY HIGH_FP state, not just net errors.
/// The #1757 net-error red-anchor exemption was too broad (fired for the token
/// ANYWHERE in the tail), so an agent merely *discussing* a net error mis-latched
/// `ServerRateLimit` → retry storm (codex's #1769 review). Gate on the token's
/// LINE looking like a real error line.
///
/// Error-line signatures (corpus-derived, `t-step1-detection-corpus`):
/// - labeled error — `\w*error\s*[:?]`: `Error:` / `API Error:` / `FetchError:` /
///   `api_error:` / `invalid_request_error:`. The `\w*` (not `\b`) fixes the
///   corpus bug where the `_error` underscore killed the old `\berror`
///   word-boundary, so `ModelUnsupported`'s `invalid_request_error:` never
///   qualified;
/// - labeled exception — `\w*exception\s*[:?]`: `ThrottlingException:` /
///   `ThrottlingError:` (AWS/Bedrock-style names kiro renders). The
///   `t-coloranchor-corpus-gate` rg-on-fixture check found kiro RateLimit
///   (`ThrottlingException: Rate exceeded …`) was the one color-gated content
///   false-negative — `Exception` has no `error` substring and the line carries
///   no `429`/JSON, so it failed every alternation above. The structured
///   `…Exception:` label is the same strong error-line signal as `…error:`; the
///   bare phrase `Rate exceeded` is deliberately NOT added — it is prose-ambiguous
///   (the #848/#854 class) and the real kiro error always carries the label;
/// - bare HTTP-status (gemini RateLimit lines with no `Error:` label):
///   `\b429\b` / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / `Too Many Requests` / `got status:`;
/// - structured-JSON error fields: `"type"|"code"|"status": "…error…"` /
///   `"reason": "…exceeded"`.
///
/// A bare prose/source mention (the const name `…NET_ERRORS:`, "the ECONNRESET
/// error happened" with no colon, "see issue 4290") does NOT qualify → stays
/// red-anchored. Checks every occurrence so a real error line alongside a prose
/// mention still qualifies. ⚠ This is the CONTENT-shape signal ONLY — it does NOT
/// change the red→content anchor decision (a follow-up pending the operator's
