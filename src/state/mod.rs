//! Agent state detection via PTY output pattern matching.
//!
//! Detection runs against the current **vterm screen text** (caller supplies
//! it via `feed()`), not an accumulated byte buffer. Pattern hits therefore
//! reflect what the user would currently see on screen, so dismissing an
//! interactive prompt (e.g. codex update menu) drops the matching text from
//! the grid and the next `feed()` re-evaluates to the underlying Idle state
//! without stale-buffer lag.
//!
//! Hysteresis: error states instant, active 2s, passive 5s.
//!
//! Hash-based dedup in `feed()`: if the screen text is identical to the
//! previous snapshot, we skip both the silence-timer bump and pattern
//! detection. This keeps invisible terminal chatter (cursor blinks, etc.)
//! from resetting timers used by hang/awaiting detection.
