//! #1665 reply-ledger (Phase 1) + #2042 Phase 2 — delivery-closure audit with
//! an actionable escalation ladder.
//!
//! Tracks, per agent, the in-flight user channel message turn and, when a turn
//! ends with the user's message un-replied, routes the obligation to the party
//! that can act on it (#2008 (a) actionable-or-silent):
//!
//! 1. **Stage 1 — nudge the agent** that owes the reply (inject, with the
//!    message id and a "use the reply tool" instruction). The Phase-1
//!    `tracing::warn!` + event-log line stay (the audit record).
//! 2. **Stage 2 — escalate to its lead** when the nudge goes unanswered for
//!    another window (inbox message to the team orchestrator).
//! 3. **Stage 3 — operator, last resort only**, phrased for humans (never a
//!    ledger WARN dump), then the obligation is latched closed.
//!
//! Each stage fires AT MOST ONCE per obligation (escalate-don't-repeat).
//!
//! **Group settlement (#2042)**: duplicate deliveries of the same logical
//! message (same sender + normalized-content hash — e.g. an operator double
//! send, or a channel-side redelivery replay) join ONE obligation group;
//! replying to any member settles the whole group, and a redelivery arriving
//! AFTER settlement opens no new obligation (a recently-settled-groups memory
//! suppresses it). Without this, N delivery ids per logical message meant a
//! reply settled one id and the rest went stale → false no-reply escalations.
//!
//! Content-hash trade-off: a user sending the SAME text for a genuinely NEW
//! event within the TTL is theoretically settled-suppressed (review r1 scanned
//! 166 historical operator messages: zero such cases; the real duplicates it
//! merged were all true duplicates). The blast radius is capped at one missing
//! stage-1 nudge — the message itself is still delivered to the agent.
//! Scope: the settled-groups memory is in-memory (`HeartbeatPair`), so the
//! suppression covers channel-reconnect replay within ONE daemon lifetime; a
//! replay arriving after a daemon restart re-opens the obligation, with the
//! same capped consequence (one redundant nudge, not an operator page).
//!
//! It is an AUDIT, not a second delivery path: it never re-delivers the
//! agent's missing reply, and — the IRON RULE — it never blocks/rejects the
//! agent. Every ledger op is infallible (a lock update) or swallows its error.
//!
//! The state hangs on the existing turn state (`HeartbeatPair.pending_user_turn`)
//! — NOT a 5th lifecycle file (#922 single-signal). The turn boundary is the
//! existing `reply_to_channel` Some→None clear sites; a supervisor-tick sweep is
//! the fallback for turns that never clear. See `/tmp/1665-spike.md`.
