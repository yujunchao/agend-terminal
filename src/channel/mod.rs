//! Channel abstraction — platform-neutral surface for messaging backends.
//!
//! This module defines the trait + types that `src/telegram.rs` (and future
//! Discord / Slack / Matrix adapters) implement. The design follows
//! `docs/archived/PLAN-channel-abstraction.md` §3.
//!
//! **Status (T1 prep scaffold):** this module is intentionally unused by any
//! call site. PR2 in the T1 series (the atomic type cut-over) is the one that
//! wires `Arc<Mutex<TelegramState>>` leaks through `Bootstrap` / `Daemon` /
//! `App` onto this trait. Everything here carries `#[allow(dead_code)]` until
//! then — the dead-code allow is consumed in PR2.
//!
//! ## Design decisions frozen in this PR
//!
//! - **`BindingRef` is opaque** — core code never reads the inner platform
//!   payload. It only holds a `kind: &'static str` discriminator and an
//!   optional human-readable `display_tag` (so the TUI / logs can render a
//!   binding without platform-specific conditionals).
//! - **Event / outbound naming** — we use the parent plan's §3.1 names
//!   (`ChannelEvent`, `OutMsg`, `MsgRef`) rather than the UX-layer plan's
//!   `InboundEvent` / `OutboundIntent` terminology. The transport trait lives
//!   in this module; UX layer sits on top (see `PLAN-channel-ux-layer.md`) and
//!   can rename as needed without touching the transport contract.
//! - **`ChannelCapabilities::Default`** — conservative "nothing supported".
//!   Concrete adapters must opt-in per capability. This makes a new adapter's
//!   feature matrix explicit at review time.

// Entire module is scaffold-only in this PR — consumed in PR2 (T1 main
// atomic cut-over). Silences dead-code on type defs and unused-imports
// on the `pub use` re-exports below.
