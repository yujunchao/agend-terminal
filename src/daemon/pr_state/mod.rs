//! #972: daemon-side PR-state aggregator.
//!
//! Joins two signals that previously lived in disjoint daemon-side
//! state stores (`ci_watch` and `auto_release`) into a single
//! per-PR state machine. When `(CI green ∧ N×VERIFIED)` converge at
//! the same `head_sha`, the daemon emits `[pr-ready-for-merge]` to
//! the PR author's inbox — eliminating the lead-kick deadlock that
//! operator caught twice on 2026-05-20 (Incident A — primary→cross
//! handoff; Incident B — CI+VERIFIED→self-merge handoff).
//!
//! ## Storage layout
//!
//! Per-PR file at `<home>/pr-state/<repo-slug>-<pr_number>.json`.
//! `<repo-slug>` is the canonical [`dispatch_hook::canonicalize_repo_slug`]
//! form with `/` replaced by `_`. Per-file (not single index) so
//! independent PR updates don't contend on one mutex.
//!
//! Writes go through [`crate::store::atomic_write`] which has the
//! post-#965 unique-tmp-filename safety (concurrent multi-PR updates
//! cannot corrupt each other).
//!
//! ## Ingestion
//!
//! Two entry points, both fire from existing daemon code:
//!
//! - [`record_ci_result`] — called from
//!   `src/daemon/ci_watch/poller.rs` right after the existing
//!   `[ci-ready-for-action]` emission. Records `CiState::Green` or
//!   `CiState::Failed { conclusion }` against the observed head SHA.
//! - [`record_verdict`] — called from
//!   `src/api/handlers/messaging.rs` right after
//!   `auto_release::enqueue_intent`. Records the verdict variant
//!   (Verified / Rejected / Unverified) with reviewer + reviewed_head.
//!
//! Both call [`scan_and_emit_for_pr`] internally to recompute derived
//! state and fire any newly-eligible events.
//!
//! ## §4.2 stale-head invariant (LOAD-BEARING)
//!
//! [`is_merge_ready`] requires `head_sha == ci_sha == every reviewer's
//! reviewed_head`. Without this invariant the aggregator would emit
//! `[pr-ready-for-merge]` for an unreviewed commit after a
//! push-after-VERIFIED → self-merge of unreviewed code = critical
//! regression. Pinned by reducer tests `repro_972_*_sha_mismatch_*`.
