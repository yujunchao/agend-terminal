//! Per-agent supervisor loop — detects pre-ready interactive stalls and
//! pushes a vterm tail to the agent's channel topic.
//!
//! Runs as a background thread spawned from both daemon mode
//! (`start_daemon`) and app mode (`app::run`). Both call paths create agents
//! via the shared `AgentRegistry`, so the supervisor needs no state beyond a
//! registry handle and the AGEND_HOME path. Shutdown is implicit: when the
//! hosting process exits, this thread dies with it.
//!
//! Detection logic lives in `health::HealthTracker::check_awaiting_operator`
//! and the transition in `state::StateTracker::set_awaiting_operator`. This
//! module is the plumbing that glues them to channel notifications.
