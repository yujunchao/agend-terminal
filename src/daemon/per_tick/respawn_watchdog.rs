//! #t-777-3: respawn-stuck watchdog — auto-recover an agent whose `Resume`
//! spawn hung and never came up.
//!
//! ## The incident (RCA `workspace/fixup-dev-2/RESPAWN-WATCHDOG-RCA-777-3.md`)
//! A broad `pkill` killed codex agents mid-session-write; the daemon then
//! re-spawned them via the `Resume` path (`daemon/mod.rs:1850`
//! `SpawnMode::Resume.downgraded_for` / app session-restore `app/session.rs:238`).
//! `resume --last` on a half-written (corrupt) session **hung**, and the agent
//! sat in `AgentState::Restarting` ~45 min with no watchdog covering it — the
//! Hung recovery ladder keys on `HealthState::Hung`, never on a respawn that is
//! itself stuck. Manual `restart_instance(fresh)` was the only fix.
//!
//! ## What this handler does
//! Each tick it flags any agent that (a) was spawned via `Resume`, (b) is still
//! in a not-yet-ready state (`Starting`/`Restarting`), (c) has been there past a
//! timeout, AND (d) has emitted no output for that timeout — then auto-recovers
//! via a **Fresh** restart through the PROVEN API path
//! (`restart_instance_autonomic` → direct `DELETE`+`SPAWN` →
//! `ApiEvent::InstanceCreated` → a fresh pane). That path works in BOTH the
//! `run_core` daemon and the **live app-mode daemon** (`run_app`), where the
//! `crash_tx`→respawn machinery is inert (agents spawn with `crash_tx: None`,
//! `pane_factory.rs`) — which is exactly why this watchdog drives recovery via
//! `api::call` instead of emitting an `AgentExitEvent`.
//!
//! ## Why `Resume`-only (the load-bearing false-kill guard)
//! Firing ONLY on `SpawnMode::Resume` is what lets the watchdog ship
//! ON-by-default safely: a slow-but-healthy *Fresh* boot is NEVER force-killed
//! (its `spawn_mode != Resume`). The Fresh respawn this watchdog itself triggers
//! is therefore never re-detected → the Resume-gate is the structural
//! loop-breaker; the K-retry cap is the explicit belt for a recurring
//! stuck-Resume pathology (e.g. a daemon that keeps restarting + re-resuming a
//! corrupt session). After K failed auto-Fresh attempts within the stability
//! window it stops retrying and escalates a P0 to the operator + pauses (the
//! terminal "auto when possible, page when auto fails" escalation).
//!
//! ## Disjoint from the Hung ladder (no double-fire)
//! `hang_detection` → `recovery_dispatcher` key on `HealthState::Hung`. This
//! watchdog keys on `AgentState::{Starting,Restarting}` + `SpawnMode::Resume`
//! and skips any agent already `HealthState::Paused` — a disjoint state class,
//! so the two never act on the same agent in the same tick.
//!
//! ## Gate-exempt by construction (operator authority)
//! The recovery goes through `restart_instance_autonomic`, whose inner
//! `DELETE`/`SPAWN` are DIRECT api methods (operator-transport — `operator_gate`
//! returns `Ok` before `classify`). It is reached ONLY from this internal
//! hang-detection tick (never agent-invocable), so it is gate-exempt by the same
//! daemon-autonomic-self-heal rationale as crash-respawn / hang-recovery: a
//! stuck resume must self-heal even while the operator is away/asleep.
