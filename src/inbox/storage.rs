// ── #inbox-gc retention bounds (decision d-20260607081209372642-1, part b) ──
//
// Root cause of the unbounded-looking inbox files: read (drained) messages were
// retained for 7 DAYS, so a high-throughput agent accumulates 1000s of read
// rows within that window. Two complementary bounds replace the single 7d TTL:
//
// 1. A shorter read TTL for the bulk (`update`/`report`/`ci`/`poll` …), and
// 2. A per-inbox SIZE CAP on retained read rows — the robust bound a TTL alone
//    can't provide (a burst inside ANY window still blows past the cap).
//
// EXEMPTION: drained `query`/`task` rows are "blockers" — they are read by
// `has_drained_blocker_for_correlation` (ack-absorption / reply-routing, see
// storage.rs `has_drained_blocker_for_correlation`) for the full task
// turnaround, which has no finite upper bound (overnight / multi-day tasks).
// They keep the original 7d window AND are exempt from the size cap so the
// audit path never regresses. Unread rows (obligations) keep the 30d window.

/// Read (drained) NON-blocker messages expire this many hours after their
/// timestamp. Lowered from 7 days — these are the high-volume `update`/`report`/
/// `ci`/`poll` rows that flood the file.
const READ_TTL_HOURS: i64 = 48;

/// Read (drained) BLOCKER rows (`kind` ∈ {query, task}) keep this longer window
/// so `has_drained_blocker_for_correlation` can still see a consumed dispatch
/// when its reply arrives late. Unchanged from the legacy read TTL.

/// implicit next-drain ack (A): a turn that DIED after a message was drained
/// leaves it `delivering` forever; this bounds the silent-loss window. Matched
/// to `notification_dedup::IDEMPOTENCY_WINDOW_SECS` (10 min) — the same horizon
/// over which a delivered message's re-inject is suppressed — so reclaim and
/// dedup expire together (and reclaim also `forget`s the dedup entry to be
